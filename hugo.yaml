          - During my bachelor's degree I learned concepts about development, databases, software engineering, machine learning, networking, and IoT
          - In the software engineering project I worked in a group of about 20 people where we developed a full-working chat system using technologies such as MongoDB, MySQL, Ionic, Socket.io, Express, and NodeJS. My main role was backend developer and I was also responsible for supervising the frontend and managing repositories (merge requests, conflicts, and issues)
          - A very formative experience was the CyberChallenge.it in which we were tested with challenges regarding all-around security; participating in competitions such as Capture The Flag and Attack/Defence. Through this experience, I learned some of the first concepts regarding software and network security
#          I Publiced two papers in the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.
#          - [Fast and Accurate Object Detection with a Single Convolutional Neural Network](https://example.com)
