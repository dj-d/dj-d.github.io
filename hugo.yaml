          - During my master's degree I learned concepts involving security, and optimization methods, and improved my knowledge regarding machine learning, and project management
          - In a project management-related exam, I was the top performer among my colleagues, as I successfully guided a group of ~15 people in the development of a full-working university's teaching evaluation survey system and other features related to the official university application using SpringBoot, MySQL, and Ionic.
          - My thesis work focuses on the design and implementation of an encrypted file system using cryptographic systems such as IBE and technologies such as TPM

        content: |
          - During my bachelor's degree I learned concepts about development, databases, software engineering, machine learning, networking, and IoT
          - In the software engineering project I worked in a group of about 20 people where we developed a full-working chat system using technologies such as MongoDB, MySQL, Ionic, Socket.io, Express, and NodeJS. My main role was backend developer and I was also responsible for supervising the frontend and managing repositories (merge requests, conflicts, and issues)
          - A very formative experience was the CyberChallenge.it in which we were tested with challenges regarding all-around security; participating in competitions such as Capture The Flag and Attack/Defence. Through this experience, I learned some of the first concepts regarding software and network security
